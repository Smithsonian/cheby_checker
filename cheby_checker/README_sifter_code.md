# sifter code-base goes in this directory

# Misc.
 - Do we need some way to track "names"/"unique-IDs" of each tracklet ?
   - In MPChecker I map names-to-integers
- Might need trid+obscode+date to make unique
- What (if anything) needs to be different between "back-fill" of 3e6 tracklets and the on-going processing of any tracklet added to the ITF ? 

# Base object ...
- File / directory locations
  - While developing, let's just save locally to files on disk
  - Need to make future decision about optimal I/O method 
- obs80 parsing methods?
- date ranges of interest
- healpix parameters 
- need definitions of "precise match" 
  
# Tracklet object ... 
- all observations or just extremal ? 
- healpix of extremal obs
- integer days of extremal obs 
- assume ~ 3e6 tracklets
- assume ~1e4 days with data
- implied only 3e2 per night 
 
# Input orbit object ...
- cheby representation of orbit: assume supplied as input ?
- calculate healpix location on integer days
- do we want "neighbors": probably 
- what do we do about really fast things 
- do we want to use velocity / RoM information ?
- do we want to use uncertainty information (CoV-Matrix / Var-Orbits) ? 
  - can we inform healpix size/scale using uncertainties in some way ?
- need to be able to query precalculations for (each) integer-day and integer-healpix
- do we want to calculate RoM / angles / etc, to help with rough-cuts? 
 
# Precalculations 
- Use tracklet objects 
- Calculate the "heapix" location of the first and last observation of each tracklet on a regular (daily?) interval, and then store the information by healpix (i.e. having a list of the objects present/close-to each healpix on each night).
- Perhaps store a tracklet "against" all nearby/neighbouring tracklets ?
